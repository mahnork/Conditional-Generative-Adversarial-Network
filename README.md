 Conditional Generative Adversarial Network (cGAN)

This repository contains an implementation of a Conditional Generative Adversarial Network (cGAN) using [insert framework, e.g., PyTorch or TensorFlow]. cGANs extend traditional GANs by conditioning both the generator and discriminator on additional information, such as class labels, enabling more controlled and targeted generation of images or data.

Features:
Modular architecture for easy customization and experimentation.

Training pipeline with support for conditional inputs (e.g., labels or attributes).

Visualization tools for monitoring generator output and loss curves.

Configurable hyperparameters and dataset loading.

Support for popular datasets like MNIST, CIFAR-10, or your own custom dataset.

Applications:
Image-to-image translation

Data augmentation

Controlled image synthesis

Style transfer

Based on the notebook content, you're implementing a Pix2Pix-style conditional GAN for medical image translation—specifically converting segmentation masks into realistic brain images ("Seg2Brain"). Here's a tailored repository description you can use:

Seg2Brain: Brain Image Synthesis from Segmentation Maps using Pix2Pix (cGAN)

This repository contains an implementation of a Conditional GAN based on the Pix2Pix framework for translating medical segmentation maps into realistic brain MR images. The model learns a mapping from segmentation labels to anatomical brain structures using paired image data, enabling high-quality synthesis useful in data augmentation, simulation, and analysis.

Features:
Based on the Pix2Pix architecture with U-Net generator and PatchGAN discriminator.

Preprocessing pipeline for paired image datasets.

TensorFlow 2.x implementation with customizable training loop.

Real-time visualization of generated images during training.

Designed for 256×256 medical images (modifiable).

Dataset:
Expects a directory of side-by-side (concatenated) image pairs (e.g., left: segmentation, right: real brain MRI).

Dataset directory should be structured with training/validation/test folders.

Use Cases:
Medical image augmentation

Synthetic data generation for segmentation models

Research on anatomy-preserving translation
