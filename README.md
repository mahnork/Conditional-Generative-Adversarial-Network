** Conditional Generative Adversarial Network (cGAN)**

This repository contains an implementation of a Conditional Generative Adversarial Network (cGAN) using [insert framework, e.g., PyTorch or TensorFlow]. cGANs extend traditional GANs by conditioning both the generator and discriminator on additional information, such as class labels, enabling more controlled and targeted generation of images or data.

**Features:**
Modular architecture for easy customization and experimentation.

Training pipeline with support for conditional inputs (e.g., labels or attributes).

Visualization tools for monitoring generator output and loss curves.

Configurable hyperparameters and dataset loading.

Support for popular datasets like MNIST, CIFAR-10, or your own custom dataset.

**Applications:**
Image-to-image translation

Data augmentation

Controlled image synthesis

Style transfer
